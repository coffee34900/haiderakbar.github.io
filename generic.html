          <p>
            Currently about to graduate in the field of mathematics from Bilkent University (with honors, I should add), I developed an interest in data analytics during my time here and worked on a specific set of skills that helped me realize this interest. 
          </p><p>            
Data exploration and data cleaning was my starting point. Hence I learnt MS excel and SQL in depth. My focus was on data relevant to the field of finance, as is reflected in the sample projects that exhibit the skill. I approach data with great caution as I only trust sets of data that have been gathered and cleaned properly, because inconsistencies in this process can result in alarmingly ‘dangerous’ outcomes in analysis and decisions. The aforementioned fact is the reason I decided to sharpen my skills in SQL and excel first, before moving onto utilization of data which was my ultimate focus.
</p>
<p>
Visualization of data is crucial for effective communication and interpretation of data. This realization led to my learning and usage of Tableau, which helped me greatly in demonstrating the skimmed data to others in a concise manner and understand the essence of the data myself, something I was  previously encountering difficulty in. It truly is a wonderful tool for industries and institutions looking to benefit from integration of vast amounts of data in their decision-making processes (and indeed every institution must benefit from data in order to retain their relevance in a highly competitive and information-driven market).
</p>
Analyzing the data, and vast amounts of it, was my eventual goal. Previously I assumed excel would suffice for this, however I found myself mistaken when faced with rather huge data sets. Python proved itself the ultimate tool for this task, and even more so given that I am a mathematician. I will not claim that to be master of Python – that would indeed take a very long time and experience of hundreds of projects. However, I am confident that my present skill level in Python more than suffices for applications in finance, statistical and fundamental analysis, something that I hope to learn in greater depth and with more precision. 

For that, I am passionately looking forward to new projects and new possibilities in a variety of fields, for I view them as the prime vehicle leading towards the actualization of my passion!
